## Acknowledgments

This repository is based on the original work [MLOps-Basics](https://github.com/graviraja/MLOps-Basics) by graviraja. I extend my gratitude to the original author and contributors for their contributions to MLOps practices.

The work presented in this repository builds upon the existing framework with improvements to adapt to the latest developments in Python packages and address issues while enhancing the MLOps stack used. My goal is to modernize the implementation to better align with current industry standards and practices while maintaining the spirit of the original project.
